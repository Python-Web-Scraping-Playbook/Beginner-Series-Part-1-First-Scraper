# üï∑Ô∏è Python Web Scraping Beginner Series Part 1: First Scraper
In Part 1 of the series, we go over the basics of how to build a scraper with Python using **Python Requests** & **BeautifulSoup**.

How this scraper was developed is explained in this [guide](https://scrapeops.io/python-web-scraping-playbook/python-web-scraping-beginners-guide/).


#### <ins>Python Web Scraping 6-Part Beginner Series</ins>

- **Part 1: Basic Python Scraper -** We will go over the basics of scraping with Python, and build our first Python scraper. ([Part 1](https://scrapeops.io/python-web-scraping-playbook/python-web-scraping-beginners-guide/))

- **Part 2: Cleaning Dirty Data & Dealing With Edge Cases -** Web data can be messy, unstructured, and have lots of edge cases. In this tutorial we will make our spider robust to these edge cases, using DataClasses and data cleaning pipelines. ([Part 2](https://scrapeops.io/python-web-scraping-playbook/python-web-scraping-beginners-guide-cleaning-data))

- **Part 3: Storing Our Data -** There are many different ways we can store the data that we scrape from databases, CSV files to JSON format, and to S3 buckets. We will explore several different ways we can store the data and talk about their Pro's, Con's and in which situations you would use them. ([Part 3](https://scrapeops.io/python-web-scraping-playbook/python-web-scraping-beginners-guide-storing-data/))

- **Part 4: Retries & Concurrency -** Make our scraper more robust and scalable by handling failed requests and using concurrency. ([Part 4](https://scrapeops.io/python-web-scraping-playbook/python-web-scraping-beginners-guide-retries-concurency))

- **Part 5: User Agents & Proxies -** Make our spider production ready by managing our user agents & IPs so we don't get blocked. ([Part 5](https://scrapeops.io/python-web-scraping-playbook/python-web-scraping-beginners-guide-user-agents-proxies))

- **Part 6: Deployment, Scheduling & Running Jobs -** Deploying our spider on a server, and monitoring and scheduling jobs via [ScrapeOps](https://scrapeops.io/). ([Part 6](https://scrapeops.io/python-web-scraping-playbook/python-web-scraping-beginners-guide-deployment-scheduling-monitoring))
